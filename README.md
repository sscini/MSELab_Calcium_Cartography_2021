# Forward Engineering Organ Development and Cancer Therapeutics with Optogenetics

This is a repository for the associated Python code for the manuscript titled: Forward Engineering Organ Development and Cancer Therapeutics with Optogenetics. 


The code was built by [Stephen Cini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-cini/), and heavily adapted from the authors of the previous manuscript model: [Dr. Ramezan Paravi Torghabeh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramezan-paravi-torghabeh-phd-b432baa0/), [Francisco Huizar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francisco-huizar-82bb1a127/), [Dharsan Soundarrajan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AWv4OiIAAAAJ&hl=en). The experimental work was done by [Dr. Mayesha Sahir Mim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mmim/).This work was done within the [Multicellular Systems Engineering Lab](http://sites.nd.edu/zartmanlab/) and [Dowling Lab](https://dowlinglab.nd.edu/) at the University of Notre Dame. Please direct any questions to the lab principal investigator, [Dr. Jeremiah Zartman](http://sites.nd.edu/zartmanlab/contacts/).


All code was done using [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks where all code was run and the visible outputs are saved in the iPython notebooks. The code is available to be downloaded and run after installation of the latest version of [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/).
